<h1>SQL Projects: Data Cleaning and Analysis</h1>

This project demonstrates my SQL skills through advanced data cleaning, analysis, and optimization applied to a layoff dataset.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL)

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying trends using window functions and ranking data.
- **Recursive Queries**: Modeling hierarchical data and calculating cumulative totals.
- **Performance Optimization**: Using indexing for faster query performance.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Using historical data to forecast future trends.

## File Organization

This project is organized as follows:

- **SQL/**: Contains SQL scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and trend forecasting.
  - `Data_Analysis.sql`: SQL queries for analyzing layoff trends.
  - `Data_Cleaning.sql`: SQL queries for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
  
- **Data/**: Contains data files for analysis.
  - `layoffs.csv`: The CSV file containing layoff data.


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Ritik-Datey/SQL-Projects.git`
2. Load the SQL scripts into your preferred SQL environment.
3. Run the SQL queries on your database and analyze the results.

## Outcome
This project highlights my ability to clean and analyze data using SQL, providing actionable insights through advanced queries and optimizations.
